# MAC Changer Script 🔄

📝 This Python script allows you to change the MAC address of a network interface on your system. It utilizes the `ifconfig` command-line tool to perform the MAC address change.

## 🎯 Prerequisites

- The script requires Python and the `re` and `subprocess` modules.
- You need to run the script with administrative privileges.

## 🖥️ Usage

1. ⚙️ Run the script in your Python environment.
2. 🔄 Enter the interface name for which you want to change the MAC address when prompted.
3. 🔄 Enter the new MAC address you want to assign to the interface.
4. 🔄 The script will attempt to change the MAC address of the specified interface.
5. 🔄 After the change, the script will display the current MAC address of the interface.
6. ⚠️ Please note that the success of the MAC address change depends on your system's configuration and the provided interface and MAC address.

## Example Execution

```
MacChanger is started!

*******************************************************************
🔄 Enter the interface: eth0
🔄 Enter the new MAC address: 00:11:22:33:44:55

*******************************************************************
MAC address was changed successfully!
```

In this example, the script changes the MAC address of the `eth0` interface to `00:11:22:33:44:55`.

⚠️ Please note that the provided example execution assumes the script is functioning correctly and the MAC address change is successful. However, the actual outcome may vary depending on the system and its configuration.
